Note: the main resource used for this assignment was developer.mozilla.org
Headers:
Alt-Svc →quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="35,34"
    -> HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc), according to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), is a custom header
        that allows a resource to be "authoritatively available at a separate location."  In essence, this means
        that if a server experiences a heavy load of traffic at its origin, it gives another
        server "permission" to utilize its resources.
Cache-Control →private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
    -> Cache-Control, as the name suggests and according to mozilla.org, determines if and how the returned data can be cached.
        "private" indicates that the response cannot be cached, as it was intended for a single user.
        "max-age" indicates the maximum amount of time that the resource will be "fresh."
        "must-revalidate" indicates that the cache must verify resources before using it if the data is "stale."
            Because the cache-control is private and the max-age is 0, must-revalidate will require a new request
        "no-transform" essentially states that the content-type (below) must remain the same and the content format cannot be modified
            to a different type or resource

Content-Length →5416
    -> The Content-Length is the length of the response in (8-bit) bytes
Content-Type →application/json; charset=UTF-8
    -> The Content-Type is of the type application/json, meaning it returns back json data.  the charset=utf-8
        means that all characters must be represented as single 8-bit bytes
Date →Sat, 04 Feb 2017 05:15:15 GMT
    -> This is the time of the request
ETag →"vFp1TYDMppbWxVi0Wgw_upD83cI/hUA_q-xY5F343LAgYVtAqRRDgcg"
    -> The ETag is a digest, typically a hash, of the returned data
Expires →Sat, 04 Feb 2017 05:15:15 GMT
    -> The Expires header is determined by the Cache-Control's max-age, which states how long the content is "Fresh."  Because it is set
        to 0, the returned data immediately expires and cannot be cached
Server →GSE
    -> This is the name of the server used that the data is extracted from, which is Google Servlet Engine in this case.
Vary →Origin
    -> The Vary header tells the server where to pull data from when it receives a request.  In some cases, if the data is already cached,
        the server will return the data from the specified cache if it is "fresh."  In this case, because nothing in the Google API is cached, the data comes
        straight from the Origin server.
Vary →X-Origin
    -> See above
X-Content-Type-Options →nosniff
    -> The X-Content-Type-Options determines whether or not the type(s) listed in Content-Type (application/json in this case)
        can be modified, similar to the "no-transform" method in the Cache-Control header.
X-Frame-Options →SAMEORIGIN
    -> The X-Frame-Options determines whether or not data can be embedded within an HTML <frame>, <iframe>, or <object> of a
        webpage.  The option SAMEORIGIN states that the content can be displayed in a <frame>, <iframe>, or <object> if it is on the same
        origin as the page itself.
X-XSS-Protection →1; mode=block
    -> The X-XSS-Protection header stop a page from loading if the browser detects cross-site scripting which may otherwise allow
        people in inject scripts to otherwise trusted web pages.  In this case, XSS filtering is enabled and the browser prevents any
        rendering of the page.
